anonymous-sums
--------------

Provides anonymous sum types for Haskell.  Kind of like `Either`,
but for multiple types rather than just two.

This is boring and tedious but sometimes I find it handy so I
shuffled it off to this library so I wouldn't have to reimplement it
each time.  I'm sure it could be done better with Template Haskell
or Scrap Your Boilerplate or some such thing...but this works, so
here it is.

The module Data.Sums is generated by another program (I generate it
manually and ship that; it's not generated at compile time.)  You
will find the source for that in generate-sums.hs.

I generated a maximum of 15 types because the Prelude includes
15-tuples, so that seemed as good a place to stop as any.  In
practice I have never needed more than four types.
